Yeah, sorry mate but I'm having trouble logging into the WebHack
 server again. It's just not letting me login. I think my 
 password might have been changed again. Can you help me?

Uh, Gh0st accused me the other day or resetting his password,
 I don't get why I'd even want to touch his stupid account,
 Just... sort his account please so I don't have to put up
 with this crap again.

Hey there Matt. Great job on the latest updates to HackNetOS it looks like
 it's coming along nicely. Soon we'll be able to get the whole program up
 and running and finally recover some of that hard work Bit has put into this.

Hey, Zak. It's me again, look I haven't heard from you in awhile
 I need to know whether this thing is still a go? I've got all the our
 scripts ready and waiting back on the FileServer, I just need your
 authorization to deploy. Please reply soon!
