Looks like you've finally broken through the final file!
 Congratulations! Only problem is now... what's the password to the email?
 Well, you've still got one more decypher task to do yet.
 
 Your next set of passwords are:
   (once again, without the quotation marks)
   - "l0g1c"
   - "ov3rfl0w"
   - "p4tch"
   
So, final encrypted file to find... The password to that one,
 is a combination of all the working passwords you've just used.
Uh oh! Weren't expecting that now were you!?!?! Well, you could
 just guess... but that's probably gonna take you awhile...
 Maybe... just maybe... a hint that you've passed over might help
 this time...
 
 
So, there is one more server you haven't discovered... I wonder
 where that is then...
