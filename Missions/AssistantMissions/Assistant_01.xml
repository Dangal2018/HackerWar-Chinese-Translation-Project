    <body>Congratulations on your first win #PLAYERNAME#!

I'm your new assistant and coach. I will be helping you out
 getting you new tools as well as giving you tips and tricks
 and a quick run down of each of your next opponents.
 
I will try my best to update you on any information you might
 find useful before embarking on your next opponent on the Battleboard!

I've also just uploaded a new hack tool to your computer. It's
 'SMTPOverflow' and it allows you to open port '25'.
 
You're next opponent is still getting ready, so why don't you pass the
 time by checking up on the latest news and forum post(s).
