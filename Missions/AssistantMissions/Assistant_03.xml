    <body>Good job #PLAYERNAME#!

That's another win! You're really starting to show some
 promise in this competition! If you keep this up you'll
 be well on your way to the team battle rounds. 
 
 Be careful though, save a trick
  or two for the bigger opponents won't you.
 
Whilst you wait for the next match, why don't you take
 another look at the News and Forum, there's some new
 information there.
