    <body>Congratulations again on getting this far #PLAYERNAME#,

It seems Mr. Tovar has taken a great interest in you, he seems to have
 made you team Captain of the second team. Naix is captain of the other
 team. Going by the forums you're not liked very much at the moment.
Don't worry though we can sort that:

It's time for you to put together your team. You should see some new contracts
 appearing on the Battleboard pretty soon.
 
Each contract will be a challenge that one of the Hacker Wars
 members wants you to do. By completing each challenge succesfully
 the Hacker Wars member will then join your team.
 
You'd better get started with each of the contracts before Naix gets
 in on one of them! Good luck!
