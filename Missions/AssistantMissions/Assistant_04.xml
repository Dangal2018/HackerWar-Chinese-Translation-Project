    <subject>Update: Round 5 Information</subject>
    <body>Okay #PLAYERNAME#,
Round 4 consisted of a battle between hackers 'Curs3' and
 '5plinter', and I have to say, '5plinter' wiped the floor
 with 'Curs3.'
 
You're up next again, final 1v1 match, with Round 5 being matched
with you versus 'Curs3.' He's feeling pretty salty after the loss 
 on that last round so I wouldn't expect him to be going easy on
 you! Watch out for him!
 
You've got a firewall to deal with this time, so watch out for
 that. It shouldn't take too long to get through it but the
 trace time is pretty quick, so you'd better get those Port 
 Crackers running first.
 
 When you're ready, go pick up the contract on the Battleboard.
