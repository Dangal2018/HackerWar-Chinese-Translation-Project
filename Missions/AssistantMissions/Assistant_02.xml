    <body>Okay #PLAYERNAME#,
It looks like you're up next again, this time you will be facing the
 hacker known as 'T4lisman.'
 
Going by his past experience and his performance last year,
 I'd say he won't be proving much more of a challenge than your
 last competitor. I've ran an nmap on his computer, we're
 looking at that SMTP port I told you about earlier.
 
He's got custom ports too, nasty stuff, just pay attention
 to the port numbers you see on screen and everything should go
 okay.
 
 When you're ready to go, pick up the contract on the Battleboard.
