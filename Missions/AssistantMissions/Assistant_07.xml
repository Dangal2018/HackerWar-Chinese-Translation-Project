    <subject>Update: Team Event Now Available</subject>
    <body>Good job #PLAYERNAME#,

It looks like you've got yourself quite the team there!
Naix has also finished gathering Team mates now, so it's
looking like:

 Team Red: Captain: "Naix"
   -  "5plinter"
   -  "Ph4n745m"
   -  "Ch1m3r4"
 
 Team Blue: Captain: "#PLAYERNAME#"
   -  "Grim4ce"
   -  "r00t"
   -  "Cryp70"
	
First team event has been published, and it's a new one
 for this year. 'Capture The Flag' You can find out more
 about how to play in the mission information. It's a
 test on team's obversation.
 
When you're ready to start, hit up the new contract on
 the Battleboard.
