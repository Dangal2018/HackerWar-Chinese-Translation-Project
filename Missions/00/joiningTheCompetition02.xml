    <body>Hello there,
You may not know me but I know you.
I know all the many things you are capable of, and all the many things you will soon be capable of too.
	
I heard you wanted to join Hacker Wars, show people what you are really made of. But they turned you down?
Yeah, sadly they push more people out than they like to let you believe on their adverts.
I feel for you kiddo, and that's why I'm going to help you out. 
	
That's right #PLAYERNAME# We're gonna hack you a place into Hacker Wars! Kind of ironic isn't it?
	
First, you are going to need to get yourself some tools. Go ahead, connect up to the server
I've linked and grab the tools you're gonna need from there now!
