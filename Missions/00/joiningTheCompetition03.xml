    <subject>Getting You A Backup Server</subject>
    <body>Alright nice work, I can see from my logs you've successfully downloaded my tools.

We're almost ready to get you set up, are you excited? Before we get stuck in we need to get you a backup server online.
This way, if you do happen to lose a competition, and something happens to your files, you can get them back with just a few SCP commands.
 
I've already set a backup server up for you, you just need to
 upload all your files to it. So get stuck in, I've attached
 the IP of your Backup Server, and a note detailing what you
 should backup.

	  <note title="Backing Up Tips">Okay, now to backup your files! Simply navigate to the folder home/BACKUP and then use upload commands to upload the following.
You need to backup:
 - System Files. - Specifically X-SERVER.sys (CRUCIAL FOR GUI, unless you want to go back to the dark ages)
 - All EXE Files - These are very important as some tools can be very useful and if you lose them, they are pretty much gone for good if you don't back them up.
