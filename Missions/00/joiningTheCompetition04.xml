Phew! I bet that's a load off now that you've backed everything up!

So, finally we've done all the boring bits, it's time to get you into Hacker Wars!
Okay, I've done some digging around and I think I've found where they store their
 database. I've attached the IP address below.
  
You need to get Administrator access on that server now. Once you're in, have a
 look for a list of participants. You're looking for a hacker named "Alexander."
Let's just say, he went on a business trip... You're replacing him.

Just be careful, DO NOT RENAME THE FILE, WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE OBVIOUS
 SOMEONE HAS HACKED IN. (That comes later)
 
I've attached details on everything you'll need to modify in the file.

	  <note title="Required Information">Once you have access to the files:
1)Locate the Hacker Entry "Alexander" You're replacing him, open that file.
2) Modify the Hacker Name at the top "Alexander" with your player name! (#PLAYERNAME#)
3) Modify the IP Address on the second line and replace with your own. This is very important.
4) DO NOT RENAME THE FILE
