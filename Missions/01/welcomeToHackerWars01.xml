    <subject>Welcome to Hacker Wars</subject>
    <body>Hi there #PLAYERNAME#,

I'm John Tovar, the head administrator of Hacker Wars,
 I'm contacting you as I'd like to personally welcome you
 to the competition!

So, Welcome #PLAYERNAME# to Hacker Wars!

Getting setup with our servers shouldn't be too difficult
 for a Hacker such as yourself. I've provided you with IP address to our new and exclusive Hacker chat system.
Here you will find the latest news as well as discussions between the other competitors.
 
You will also find attached a login to our main Hub server where you will be able to see
 who you are up against next and start a new game with another competitor.
 
I think that covers everything, I will be watching out for you in the games!

Good luck!
 
 - John Tovar
 CEO at Hacker Wars
