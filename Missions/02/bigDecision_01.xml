    <body>Hey there #PLAYERNAME#,

I have to say I'm quite impressed with how well you've
 done during Hacking Wars. I don't regret choosing you
 out of all the failed applicants to enter into the
 competition.
 
I have a favour to ask, I could use your help. It's
 kind of embarassing being the one who helped you 
 hack Hacker Wars.
 
Someone has stolen a file from me, and it's really important.
 I NEED that file back, and I can't get into their system,
 my IP would show up red flags everywhere, so it's up to you.
 
I must stress this file is TOP SECRET, and I cannot have
 you read it, you're just going to have to trust me.
 
 Good luck! I'm sure you won't need it.
