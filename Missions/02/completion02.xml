    <subject>Thank You For Playing Hacker Wars</subject>
    <body>Hi there #PLAYERNAME#,

Due to an ongoing investigation going by the name
 of 'Unknown', the ICD have been forced to
 temporarily close Hacker Wars for this year, we
 therefore cannot declare an official winner for
 this year, due to your performance through the
 Hacker Wars games, you have been invited to
 participate in next years games.
 
 Congratulations, #PLAYERNAME#!

This originally started out as a bit of half-term
project but has vast taken over the last couple of
weeks as more and more ideas have been thrown at it.
