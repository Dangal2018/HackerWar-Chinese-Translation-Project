    <body>Hey there #PLAYERNAME#,

I have recently been informed that you have submitted
 a report to us linked to a case we've been working on
 for quite some time, dating all the way back to the first
 Hacker Wars I don't know how you came across this evidence
 but it will be the perfect to finally close this case against Lazarus.
 
You can be asserted that we will keep this tip completely
 anonymous so you will not need to worry about getting
 found out.
