    <body>Thank you for returning my file #PLAYERNAME#,
	
You've done the right thing, returned to me what was
 wrongfully stolen. But I'm sorry, you know too much
 and I cannot let you roam free any longer. This is
 goodbye from me, this is probably the last time we
 will ever talk... I'm sorry, but it had to be this
 way.
 
 I can't have anything linking back to me...
