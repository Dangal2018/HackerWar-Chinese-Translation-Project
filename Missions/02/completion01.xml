    <subject>Thank You For Playing Hacker Wars</subject>
    <body>Hi there #PLAYERNAME#,

Due to the recent events that have happened leading
 to Lazarus' capture, the ICD have been forced to
 temporarily close Hacker Wars for this year, we
 therefore cannot declare an official winner,
 however due to the amazing skills that were
 shown during the games as well as the bravery
 of our newest hacker to report such a criminal
 to the ICD, we can see only one course of action,
 to make you the winner of this year's Hacker Wars!
 
 Congratulations, #PLAYERNAME#!
