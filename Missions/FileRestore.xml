    <body>Hi there #PLAYERNAME#,

Unlucky my friend! You lost that round, but don't worry, 
 you can have another go. First, you've gotta restore your
 files though, which if you are reading this, means you already
 have. I left you instructions on restoring a file on your
 computer just in case you needed them.
 
It might also be a good idea if you double check your "bin"
 folder. Cause, some of the hackers, they like to replace
 your tools... You may need to download some replacements from 
 your Backup server!
 
Once you have restored your files, the contract should be restored
 on the Battleboard once again. So, as soon as you are ready, why
 don't you have another go?
