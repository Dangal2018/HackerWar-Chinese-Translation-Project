    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#,

There is a rather nasty kid who is bullying a lot of
 other kids online. I'd like your help to get back at
 him. I've managed to forge a piece of evidence that
 is going to get him into a lot of trouble. But I need
 your help to deploy it. When you are ready I've linked
 you to my server with an account below. Once you're in
 download the file "evidence.docx"
 
Once you have the file you should have no trouble
 penetrating the bully's security. Once through
 just upload the file into his HOME folder. Make sure
 you clear the logs afterwards though. We don't want any
 evidence pointing to someone else now do we?

 
BATTLEBOARD REMINDER: When you have completed Grim4ce's
 task she will become an official member of your team.
