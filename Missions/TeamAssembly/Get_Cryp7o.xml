    <body>#PLAYERNAME#,

I've got a hilarious prank to play on one of the Hacker Wars
 members. You remember 5plinter right? He's crazy proud, why
 don't we show him a little fun Cryp7o style ;)
 
I want you to break in to his Laptop and get admin access.
From there, I need you to download all his tool files and
 then delete them from his laptop. Once you've got the file
 upload them to my computer (also linked below) I'm going to
 encrypt them with a super secure password :)


BATTLEBOARD REMINDER: When you have completed Cryp7o's
 task he will become an official member of your team.
