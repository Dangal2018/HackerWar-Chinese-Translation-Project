    <body>#PLAYERNAME#,

I've got a task for you, I'm currently hosting a website
 that I built for my friends to use. Only problem is it
 has been mysteriously crashing recently and I cannot
 figure out why. 
 
I need you to login to the server and take a look at the
 logs. See if you can find something/someone that is
 causing the website to crash. As soon as you do,
 I want that hacker taken down! So go ahead and connect
 to him and take his system files!

 
BATTLEBOARD REMINDER: When you have completed r00t's
 task she will become an official member of your team.
