>Welcome to the second year...

>that guy took the entire elgoog server...

------------------------------------------
>HOLY S***...

Now now, no need for all that language
is there? Though I have to admit that's
pretty impressive!
------------------------------------------
>no need for all that language

There's always one person that has to be
like that isn't there?
------------------------------------------
>There's always one person that has to...

Of course! No forum is complete without
that someone... Even if they are 
annoying as hell.
