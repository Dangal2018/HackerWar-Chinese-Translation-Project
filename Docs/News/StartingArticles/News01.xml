Well, Hacker_Wars 2 has started off with one hell of a bang this year!
With a phenominal performance in the first round between two rival hackers:
 Naix   vs.  Splinter
Both players proved very competitive as they raced through one another's ports,
 pinging their connections all over the country trying desperately to evade trace
 and destroy the other ones proxy!
 
After much work with his terminal Splinter managed to break through ports 22;21 and
 but he just wasn't ready for Port 554, and Naix has taken the win!
 
We have a couple of new contestants this year, let's see how each one of them faces
 in our next round!
