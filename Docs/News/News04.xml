  <posting title="#PLAYERNAME# Has done it again!">
Once again our previously unknown hacker, #PLAYERNAME# has
 surprised us with another amazing victory! 
This time the hacker was pitted up against 'T4lisman'
 another relatively new hacker that made it very far
 in last year's tournaments! I think it's back to the
 drawing board for him!
 
With such an impressive solo act from #PLAYERNAME#, only
 a couple of questions remains for this hacker. How is he
 going to perform in the team stages later on and Who are
 his team members going to be?
